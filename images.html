    <!--this is how we can show images on our we page
    the first src is the source of the image and alt is what happens when the image
    fails to render-->
    <!-- <img src="image.jpeg" alt="Alfa romeo" width="400px"> -->
    <!--the third attribute is how we can control the width-->

    <!--unsplash is a website from where we can use high quality images for commercial purposes-->
    <!--to copy an image from the web copy its image addresss-->

    <!--dont add spaces between image names because that can cause issues with the page-->
<!-- 

    This is for responsive image handling â€” showing different images based on screen size or device resolution.

    ðŸ“Œ How it works:
    <source> elements define rules for when to load different images.

    media="(min-width: 650px)" means:

    "Use this image only if the screen width is 650px or more."

    The <img> tag at the end acts as a fallback:

    If none of the media queries match, use this image.

    

    <picture>
        <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="images.jpeg"/>
        <source media="(min-width: 350px)" srcset="images.jpeg"/>
        <img src="images.jpeg" alt="Alfa romeo">
    </picture> -->

    <!-- Image Map Generated by http://www.image-map.net/ -->
    <img src="images.jpeg" usemap="#image-map">


    <!--maps are usually how insta or facebook tags something in pictures-->
    <map name="image-map">
        <area onclick="one()" target="" alt="" title="" href="" coords="25,71,188,156" shape="rect">
        <area onclick="two()" target="" alt="" title="" href="" coords="36,15,101,47" shape="rect">
    </map>

    <!--alert is what we see as a pop up with an exclamation mark in our browser
    onclick is a function which says what to do when something is clicked and we can write what to do inside the parenthesis
    here we have called our 2 js functions which we declared below-->



    <script>

        // this is where we can write our javascript inside the script 

        function one()
        {
            alert("clicked on Alfa")
        }

        two = () =>
        {
            alert("you clicked on 2")
        }
    </script>
