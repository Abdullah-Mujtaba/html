    rel wants to know what we are linking for css we write stylesheet

    <p>This is <b>important</b></p> <!--<b> makes a text bold-->
    <!--we should use css to make stuff bold but when we want to show that this is 
    important information we should do this -->
    <p>This is me using <strong>strong</strong></p>
    <p>This is me using <em>strong</em></p>
    <!--the i tag makes the word in italic, em does the same thing and we prefer to use that
    -->
    
    <!--to make a bullet list-->
    <ul>
        <li>hello</li>
        <li>world</li>

    <!--another way of doing the same thing, ul>li*4 makes a list of 4-->
    <ul>
        <li>b,strong</li>
        <li>i, em</li>
        <li>sub, sup</li>
        <li>small</li>
        <li>del,mark</li>
    </ul>

    <p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p> <!--<sub> puts something in the subscript of the preceeding 
        letter-->
    
    <p>2 <sup>2</sup> = 4</p> <!--sup puts something in the power-->

    <p> <del>hello</del> </p> <!--<del> adds a line over the text-->

    <p>my name is <mark>max</mark></p> <!--<mark> highlights the text-->


    <!--the styling is done through css but if we need inline styling we use the 
    styling attribute-->

    <!--the last part tells how opaque we want the color to be-->
    <h3 style="text-align: center; background-color:rgba(0, 128, 0,0.5); color: blue">This heading needs some styling</h3>
    <!--text align as we know aligns the text and background color
    sets the background color of the whole line to the said color-->
    
    <!--global attributes are those that can be added with any tag-->

    <!--inline styling is useful when we want to do conditional rendering
    eg if a user is not logged in then a different color-->



    <p>
        <!--this is treated differently by the web
        the additional attribute max says that this is cited from max
        shows a url or name that where was this cited frm
        not visible unless visibly untill styled by css-->
        <blockquote cite="Max">this is a quote</blockquote>
    </p>

    <!--this is another way of adding quotes usually not used-->
    <q>This is how we can add quotes to our quotation by using</q>

    <abbr title ="Hyper text markup language">HTML</abbr>
    <!--this shows a text when we hover over the actual text that what is the fullform
    of it we have to define the full forms by ourselves-->
