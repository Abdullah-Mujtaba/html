    <!-- in the action field we put the thing that we have to submit this data to for eg a backend url -->
     <!-- now there is another field called method, which has 2 options get and post
      we use post method usually when sending data, it is enrcyted and sent to the database/server if using https
      data resides in the body-->

      <!-- post sends data in the body -->

      <!-- in get method our data is sent in simple text form and is visible in the url, get is not suitable for 
       passwords or personal data, it appends the data in the url -->

    <form action="url" method="GET" accept-charset="UTF-8" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <!-- what enctype does sets the form to accept only text or also allow the user to add images from browse button -->
        <!-- everything encapsulated inside the form is sent at once to the server -->

         shows the given text to the side of the button -->
         <!-- by adding id to the button and referring that in the 
          for of label what happens is when we click on first name
          it goes to that input field -->
